1. extract ! = extract( unit from date)

SELECT film.film_id, film.title, inventory_id
FROM film
LEFT OUTER JOIN inventory ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
WHERE inventory_id IS NULL
ORDER BY title;
--------------------------
Q1 I want to know the total amount by the month of my highest growing month.

SELECT SUM(amount), extract(month from payment_date) AS month
FROM payment
Group by month
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT SUM(amount) AS total, extract(month from payment_date) AS month
FROM payment
Group by month
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 1;



*Mathematical Functions
SELECT round (AVG(amount),2)
FROM payment;

SELECT customer_id + rental_id AS new_id
FROM payment;


*String functions

SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name As full_name >> in order to put a space between first_name and last_name
FROM customer;



SELECT first_name, char_length(first_name)
FROM customer;


SELECT upper(first_name)
FROM customer;


*SUBQUERY 
subquery allows us to use multiple SELECT statements, where we basically have a query within a query.
q1. we want to find the films whose rental rate is higher than the average rental rate.
A1.find the AVG first using SELECT function, and the use the first resulf of first query at the 2nd SELECT function.
A2 using subquery
SELECT title, rental_rate
FROM film
WHERE rental_rate > (SELECT AVG (rental_rate) FROM film);
